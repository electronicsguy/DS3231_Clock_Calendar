# Clock and Calendar Display 
## with DS3231 RTC Module & SH1106 OLED Display


This project shows you how to use a real-time clock (RTC) module alongwith an OLED Display to display the current time and calendar.
The development board used is the Waveshare ESP32S3 board, but any modern IoT board will do with appropriate changes.

The project is derived from 2 amazing projects as described below:
1. https://www.hackster.io/lucasio99/clock-with-sh1106-oled-display-ds1302-rtc-module-518a4c

2. https://github.com/kriswiner/DS3231RTC/blob/master/DS3231RTCBasicExample.ino

It will show all the information obtained from the RTC module:
1. Current time, day, date
2. Temperature, aging offset
